## Introduction
The ZigZag Fibo Retracement code is an MQL5 indicator that calculates the ZigZag indicator and plots Fibonacci retracement levels based on the last ZigZag point. The indicator helps identify potential support and resistance levels in the market.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into different sections for initialization, deinitialization, and calculation. Each section performs specific tasks to ensure the indicator functions correctly.

## Input Parameters
The code includes the following input parameters:
- `ZigzagDepth`: Depth parameter for the ZigZag indicator
- `ZigzagDeviation`: Deviation parameter for the ZigZag indicator
- `ZigzagBackstep`: Backstep parameter for the ZigZag indicator
- `FibonacciLevels`: Number of Fibonacci levels to plot

These input parameters can be adjusted according to your trading preferences.

## Global Variables
The code utilizes the following global variables:
- `fibonacciLevels[]`: Array to store the calculated Fibonacci levels
- `lastFiboLevel`: Last calculated ZigZag point used for Fibonacci level calculation

## Indicator Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets the necessary indicator properties, such as the price scale and indicator name.

## Indicator Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It cleans up any allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

## Indicator Calculation
The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It calculates the ZigZag indicator using the specified parameters and then calculates the Fibonacci levels based on the last ZigZag point. The Fibonacci levels are plotted on the chart as text objects.

## Product Description
The ZigZag Fibo Retracement indicator is a powerful tool for identifying potential support and resistance levels in the market. It calculates the ZigZag indicator and plots Fibonacci retracement levels based on the last ZigZag point. The indicator is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust the ZigZag parameters and the number of Fibonacci levels to plot.

To use the ZigZag Fibo Retracement indicator, simply attach it to your desired chart in MetaTrader 5. You can adjust the input parameters according to your trading preferences. The indicator will then plot the ZigZag lines and Fibonacci retracement levels on the chart, providing valuable insights into potential price levels.
